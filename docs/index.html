        <h2>About This Project</h2>

        <p><strong>Copywork</strong> is the practice of handwriting or typing out passages from works of admired authors to internalize their style, rhythm, and techniques, helping fiction writers improve their own craft through imitation and analysis.</p>
        <p><strong>H.P. Lovecraft</strong> was an early 20th-century American writer renowned for his unique blend of cosmic horror, existential dread, and richly detailed mythos, whose works are loved for their ability to evoke a profound sense of awe and terror at humanity's insignificance in a vast, uncaring universe.</p>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Lovecraft Copywork</strong>, a platform where fiction writers (like you!) can practice copywork with the chilling words of H.P. Lovecraft. Select a piece from the list above and start typing to immerse yourself and absorb the writing styles from the eerie world of cosmic horror.</p>
